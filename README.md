# Image processing on greyscale images using C++
### A C++ application for basic image operations, including adjustments, filters, and drawing primitives. Supports grayscale PGM (P2/P5) images.
### This application provides a variety of image operations, including:
* Brightness and contrast adjustments
* Gamma correction
* Convolution filters with predefined kernels
### Additionally, it supports drawing simple shapes such as:
* Lines (Bresenhamâ€™s line algorithm)
* Circles (Midpoint circle algorithm)
* Rectangles
